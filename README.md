# What is Project NERV?
Project NERV is a work-in-progress custom firmware for Samsung Galaxy devices. It's based on the latest and greatest iteration of Samsung's UX and it also includes additional features and tweaks to ensure the best possible experience out of the box.
It is based on the UN1CA build system which allows automatic downloading/extraction of the firmware, applying the required patches and generating a flashable zip/tar package for the specified target device.
Project NERV supports devices with SM7325 (Snapdragon 778G) and maybe SM8350 (Snapdragon 888).

# Features
